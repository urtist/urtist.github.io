		<p>Hey everybody!</p>
		<p>Meet Shriya, your average college girl. She’s finished her studies in India and is now pursuing her MS in one of the most happening places in the US, LA! She has a passion for re-reading her trove of Agatha Christie and PG Wodehouse books and religiously does POP Pilates errrrryday. (psst… It’s an obsession with her *rolls eyes*)
		</p>
		<p>She knows she loves writing and has this crazy itch to do creative stuff all the time but there’s this little thing called laziness that stops her every single time. Sigh.
		But no more! She’s here to share her little urt pieces with you on her blog to show you how (not to stalk people and sneakily draw them but ) to draw you into her world of color and Urt!
		</p>
